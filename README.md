#### About me 
I am Xerxes, a 22-year-old computer science graduate on a mission to revolutionize web development. With a fire for technology and a talent for coding, I'm not just creating websites that work well, I'm crafting digital masterpieces that leave a lasting impact. I am never satisfied with mediocrity and am always pushing myself to improve and stay ahead of the curve. I take pride in turning ideas into reality and building user experiences that are seamless and captivating. I am determined to make my mark as a web developer, not just for myself, but for everyone who interacts with my creations.

#### Thought of the day
We all know when we started to code this...
```
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```
It felt like we were solving the world's problems :hand_over_mouth:

#### Currently working on
As of now, I hold a full tie job in IT while being fortunate enough to take part in the Hyperiondev Web Development Bootcamp.

#### Learning and proud
My HTML, CSS, JS, Node, React and CMD skills have definately been put to the test with the Hyperiondev Bootcamp, however it has made me more confident in tackling challenges and my overall problem solving skills have become sharper.
